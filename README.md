# HoloBattlezone
Windows Holographic version of the [Tanks tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/tanks-tutorial) from Unite Boston 2015.

## Implementation Notes
The current version has only been tested on Windows 10 desktop for now and doesn't support VR or Windows Holographic yet. This is a work in progress and it is currently only playable using a keyboard on PC with an isometric camera view that follows the tanks.

**Unity version: 5.5.0f3 Release**
